# 🌌 simple node app

This app is a basic Node.js server built with Express.js that serves a homepage and provides a RESTful API for user management. It allows you to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a simple dataset of users, with routes organized for easy scalability. Static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are served from a public directory, while JSON data can be handled for API requests. The app includes error handling for invalid routes and supports customizable routing through Express Router.
